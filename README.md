# Dependency Check-In
*"The easy way to keep in contact with your juvenile dependency Case Manager!"*
 
Users can create an account that allows them to opt in to receive bi-weekly text messages as a reminder to complete mandated contact with their case management organization. The user completes a sign up form that includes their case management organization, name, phone number, address, oldest child's name, username/password. Once an account is created, on a bi-weekly basis the user can log in to confirm or edit their address, phone number and check off on any barriers to case plan complete that they are experiencing at that time. 

  Once users confirm their address, phone number and barriers, the information is sent via email to the case management organization attached to the user's account. The CMO can set up a standalone email account to receive check-in emails. The email can be forwarded to the current CM, CMS, attorney and GAL as needed.
